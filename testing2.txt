Just trying to practice forks and pull req - LDG - 20221121 (content ms)
I just noticed - to make a fork you first need to import repository ( you need to know the url path from other account) - changing this doc for practice 20221121
That is incorrect (whats above) - you firstly set up repository and in the same accout you add colaborators, colaborator must accept and can do fork...
